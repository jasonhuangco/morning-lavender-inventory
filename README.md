## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Material-UI (MUI) for responsive components
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Storage**: localStorage + Google Sheets API
- **Email**: EmailJS for order notifications
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with MUI theming

## EmailJS Template Variables

Your EmailJS template should include these variables:
- `{{to_email}}` - Recipient email (jason@morninglavender.com)
- `{{location_name}}` - Location name
- `{{user_name}}` - Person who did the count
- `{{order_date}}` - Date of the order
- `{{items_list}}` - List of items to order
- `{{total_items}}` - Total number of items

## Data Structure

The app uses localStorage for immediate access and reliable data persistence. All data is stored locally in your browser, including:

- **Products**: Name, categories, suppliers, location-specific thresholds
- **Locations**: Name and address information  
- **Categories**: Color-coded organization tags
- **Suppliers**: Vendor information
- **Sessions**: Complete inventory count history
- **Order History**: Tracking of all submitted orders with dates and quantities

Google Sheets cloud sync integration is planned for future releases.
